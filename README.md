======

A much required game jam focusing on getting a simple product finished.

So far:
- set up room and obstacles
- reworked target creation, randomized distance, movement across screen, randomized movement speed
-  boss creation, movement back and forth, approaching movement, multiple hit requirement
- gun controls, hit detection based on mouse location, ammo system, points awarded for hits
- gun sounds, decals, and fading
- basic win/loss states
- start of melee system: spawn of hit targets which will be destroyed by ASDF keys
- test power up that increases attack speed


Soon:
- rework of room and obstacles
- proper menu system: highscores, exit, play
- code clean up
- unique gun properties

Later:
- penalties and power ups
- unique levels (cover, targets, mechanics)
- dark level
- return fire that must be shot down
- boss fight quick time events
