======

A much required game jam focusing on getting a simple product finished.

So far:
- set up room and obstacles
- target creation, randomized distance, movement across screen, randomized movement speed
-  boss creation, movement back and forth, approaching movement, multiple hit requirement
- gun controls, hit detection based on mouse location, ammo system, points awarded for hits
- gun sounds
- basic win/loss states

Soon:
- gun damage decals (randomized) that fade over time
- crop and apply randomized textures applied to targets
- proper menu system: highscores, exit, play
- code clean up

Later:
- penalties and power ups
- unique levels (cover, targets, mechanics)
- dark level
- return fire that must be shot down
- boss fight quick time events
